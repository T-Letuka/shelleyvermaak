      "Gestalt Play Therapy focuses on bringing the child into a state of self-awareness. The process of self-awareness is made possible by the dynamic reciprocal relationship between the child and the therapist. Gestalt Therapy takes into account the existential realities of the child, it recognises that the child does not exist in isolation and that through dialogue and play the child is able to prepare him or herself for what is happening in his / her world.During play a child learns to control his/her emotions, he or she learns to make decisions and to see things differently. The child learns to express what is currently on his/her mind. In order to bring about change in a child they must accept themselves for who they are at that particular moment. The therapist accepts the child unconditionally without question.",

    paragraph:
      "Trauma must be distinguished from other painful experiences, as not all negative experiences qualify as trauma. Trauma, by definition, is always distressing and disturbing, leading to mental or emotional challenges that often persist over time.It is an emotional response to a profoundly difficult or unpleasant event, disrupting an individual's stability and sense of control. Trauma is deeply disturbing, impacting trust and leaving individuals feeling immobilized. Symptoms may include anxiety, safety concerns, depression, anger, hyper-vigilance, distrust, and potentially Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.Trauma fundamentally alters one's approach to life. Trauma Counseling aims to provide perspective, identify stress responses, and help individuals acknowledge and cope with their losses.",

      "School going children, and even adults, often need help in developing healthy coping mechanisms. Working within a group can be very helpful, especially for the learner or adult that does not like to speak out or is more of an introvert. Within a group setting they can be quiet, yet they don't feel alone, while listening to others others talk about what they are going through.Some, but not all of the topics I can discuss are Self-Esteem, Self- Respect, Anger, Bullying, Emotional Management, Boundaries, Codependency, Positive Relationships, Addiction, Trauma, Mental Health Issues.Whatever your need is at the time, I will let you now if I have enough knowledge to present a group specified by you.",
